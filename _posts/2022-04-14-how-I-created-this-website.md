This website was built using GitHub Pages and Jekyll, a Ruby-based static site generator for simple, blog-focused sites like this. Once the structure of the site is set up you can simply pass the content, written in Markdown, through the Jekyll templates. A full static website is then generated and hosted completely from your GitHub repository.

There's a lot of great documentation out there, but I found [this quickstart guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) especially helpful. Here's a few other resources I liked:

- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- [A Complete Guide to CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
- [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
