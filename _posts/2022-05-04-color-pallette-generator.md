A simple color pallette generator built with VueJS.

[Check it out here](https://jayorten.github.io/colorPalleteGenerator/)

One thing to note: 

The API I used to get the colors, [colormind.io](http://colormind.io/), uses HTTP protocol rather than HTTPS. It's nature causes browsers such as Chrome to flag the app as insecure. To get around this, you must go to the site settings (the lock next to the URL in Chrome) and allow insecure content. This is okay, because you're not giving the site something like credit card information.
